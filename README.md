# FaQ:
***Why Isn't The Save-Editor Complete?***

- *In It's Current State, It is "finished" basic editing is supported. Not much advanced editing at the moment.*

***Why Are The Feature Updates Going To Take So Long?***

- *I'm A Single Developer, And these updates need to be throughly developed/tested so I can minimize the risk of Data Corruption.*

***When I Try To Edit Anything The Program Crashes. Why?***

- *Very commom problem with any Python-Base Save-Editor. But the most common solution is to get "permissions" to write to the file.*
