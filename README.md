# FaQ:
***Why Isn't The Save-Editor Complete?***

- *In It's Current State, It is "finished". But it will have more updates, and Save-Editng Options as time goes on.*

***Why Are The Feature Updates Going To Take So Long?***

- *I'm A Single Developer, And these updates need to be throughly developed/tested so I can minimize the risk of Data Corruption.*

***When I Try To Edit Anything The Program Crashes. Why?***

- *Very commom problem with any Python-Based Save-Editor. But the most common solution is to get "permissions" to write to the file.*

***Any System Requirements?***

- *"Python 3.7+" is Required Along With a Standard x86 Intel or x86 AMD Processor.*

***Any ARM-Processor Support?***

- *No Testing was done on Any ARM-Based Processors. So there is no guarantee that it will work.*
